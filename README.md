# EinsteinDB
EinsteinDB is a new kind of database that can handle extremely large amounts of data. With its Write Amplificator, it can write data at speeds up to 5 milliseconds, which is faster than any other database on the market. \
EinsteinDB also has features that make it unique, such as its ```Unified Key Format and Horn Rules```. 
# Database Choice for Petabytes and Beyond
EinsteinDB is the perfect choice for personal or business computing that needs to handle large amounts of data. With its Write Amplificator, it can write data at speeds up to 5 milliseconds, which is faster than any other database on the market.

EinsteinDB s a powerful continuum database that unifies major data structure designs. 


In a nutshell, ```einstein_db``` is a ```persistent indexing scheme``` based off of LSH-KVX that exploits the distinct merits of hash Index and B+-Tree Index to support universal range scan which transcends key-value ranges using topographic categories of mumford grammars. 

The practical beneﬁt of einstein_db is that it creates a fast inference interlocking_directorate with GPT3 , it then generates a bootstrap SQL design of data structures which engages with OpenAI: An AllegroCL meta-language. For example, we can near instantly predict how a speciﬁc de­sign change in the underlying storage of a data system would aﬀect performance, or reversely what would be the optimal data structure (from a given set of designs) given workload characteristics and memory budget. In turn, these prop­erties allow us to envision new class self-designing SolitonId-causet_locale stores with substantially improved ability to adapt to workload and hardware changes by transitioning between drastically different data structure designs on demand.


## Key Features
- Unified Key Format: allows you to abstract your data center into spacetime
- Write Amplificator: writes data at speeds up to 5 milliseconds
- Horn Rules: give you the ability to query the database for historical data
- Bulk-Carrier: allows you to process large amounts of data quickly
- Post-Quantum Stateless Merkle Trees: provides security for your data
- Quantum-Tolerant: provides security for your data
