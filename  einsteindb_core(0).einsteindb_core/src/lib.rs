TODO consider having HasTopoInstance store shellings instead of actual keywords so that we can still use keyword type inference whenever possible without having to explicitly convert from shellings to keywords all over the place - this may make things easier for us later when writing queries as well.... ? So yeah I'm going to go ahead with storing strings internally unless/until someone complains about that being inconvenient at some point....   But then again I guess one way or another people will need to convert between shelling tokens and strings to pass values around after all....  For example you might serialize your query into JSON using json-rust which doesn't know anything about clojure data structures... weird huh? :) Or you could send things out over HTTP using hyper which takes care of string->shelling->string conversions behind the scenes... who knows... Addendum Actually one thing I *do* kindof regret is that our tuples are stored as Strings rather than Keywords because Keywords seem like they would be much nicer in terms of human readability.... but then again Strings are probably sufficient most of the time too especially if people want access via clojure maps or whatever Lispy equivalent there is..... So yeah anyway let's go with what works for now - even
