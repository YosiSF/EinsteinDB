// A trivial interface for extracting information from a transact as it happens.
// We have two situations in which we need to do this:
//
// - InProgress and Conn both have attribute caches. InProgress's is different from Conn's,
//   because it needs to be able to roll back. These wish to see changes in a certain set of
//   attributes in order to synchronously update the cache during a write.
// - When observers are registered we want to flip some flags as writes occur so that we can
//   notifying them outside the transaction.
